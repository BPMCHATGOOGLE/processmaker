12. Click **Save**. The following message displays: The **Data Connector was saved**.

#### Add an Endpoint Request Header

Similar to a [request body](edit-a-data-connector.md#add-an-endpoint-request-body), a request header is not be confused with a ProcessMaker [Request](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md). An API request header is part of the ProcessMaker Data Connector Endpoint's interaction with a data source's resource that contains metadata regarding that interaction. A request header is included when an Endpoint makes a request to \(contacts\) the data source resource; likewise, the resource includes a response header that is included when that resource responds to that request. Headers are used to provide information to both the ProcessMaker Data Connector and the data source. Headers can be used for many purposes, including authentication and providing information about the body content of the request/response.

Headers are key-value pairs that are separated by a colon \(`:`\). For example, the `Content-Type` request header option below indicates to the data source to expect the Endpoint's content to be JSON.

```text
"Content-Type: application/json"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
See this [list of header options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) that may be used in an Endpoint's request header.
{% endhint %}

Each header option added to an Endpoint are included in the request header when the Endpoint makes its request to the data source.

Follow these steps add a request header to a ProcessMaker Data Connector's Endpoint:

1. [Add](edit-a-data-connector.md#add-an-endpoint-to-a-processmaker-data-connector) or [view](edit-a-data-connector.md#view-an-endpoint-in-a-processmaker-data-connector) the Endpoint for the ProcessMaker Data Connector to which to add a request header.
2. Expand the **Request Headers** panel. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/endpoints-tab-header-data-connector-package.png) 
3. Click the **+Header** button. The request header settings display. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/endpoints-tab-header-settings-data-connector-package.png) 
4. In the **Key** setting, enter the key for the header request option.
5. In the **Value** setting, enter the value for that key.
6. In the **Description** setting, enter a description for this header request option.

#### Add an Endpoint Request Body

Similar to the [request header](edit-a-data-connector.md#add-an-endpoint-request-body), a request body is not be confused with a ProcessMaker [Request](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md). An API request body is part of the ProcessMaker Data Connector Endpoint's interaction with a data source's resource that contains the body or message of that interaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
Request bodies are not required for Endpoints that use the GET method since the GET method receives data from the data source but does not send content.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps add a request body to a ProcessMaker Data Connector's Endpoint:

1. [Add](edit-a-data-connector.md#add-an-endpoint-to-a-processmaker-data-connector) or [view](edit-a-data-connector.md#view-an-endpoint-in-a-processmaker-data-connector) the Endpoint for the ProcessMaker Data Connector to which to add a request body.
2. Expand the **Request Body** panel. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/endpoints-tab-body-data-connector-package.png) 
3. In the **Request Body** panel, enter the request body to send when this Endpoint makes its request to the data source.

#### Add Endpoint Sample Request Data

An Endpoint may send sample ProcessMaker Request data when that Endpoint makes it request to the ProcessMaker API so that the ProcessMaker API resource may process that Request data prior to its response.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not send ProcessMaker Request data to data source other than the ProcessMaker API. A third-party data source cannot recognize the Request data.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps add sample Request data to a ProcessMaker Data Connector's Endpoint:

1. [Add](edit-a-data-connector.md#add-an-endpoint-to-a-processmaker-data-connector) or [view](edit-a-data-connector.md#view-an-endpoint-in-a-processmaker-data-connector) the Endpoint\(s\) for the ProcessMaker Data Connector to which to add sample Request data.
2. Expand the **Sample Data** panel.
3. In the **Sample Data** panel, enter the sample ProcessMaker Request data to send when this Endpoint makes its request to the data source.
