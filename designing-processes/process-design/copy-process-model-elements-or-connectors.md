# Copy Process Model Elements or Connectors

## Copy a Start Event Element

Copying a Start Event element copies the original along with its current settings, making it easier and faster to continue designing without adding default elements or [connectors](model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md) with their default settings.

The copied Start Event element displays below the original. Any [Sequence Flow](model-your-process/process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#sequence-flow) and/or [Message Flow](model-your-process/process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#message-flow) elements incoming to or outgoing from the original are not copied.
