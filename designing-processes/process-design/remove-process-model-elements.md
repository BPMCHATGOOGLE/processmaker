# Delete Process Model Elements or Connectors

## Delete Process Model Elements or Connectors

Deleting a Process model element or a [connector](model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md) also deletes any [Sequence Flow](model-your-process/process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#sequence-flow) and/or [Message Flow](model-your-process/process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#message-flow) elements incoming to or outgoing from that element. For example, if a Process model element is deleted that has both incoming and outgoing Sequence Flow elements, the Sequence Flow elements must be reconnected for the remaining elements/connectors.

### Delete a Pool Element

{% hint style="warning" %}
When a Pool element is deleted, all elements and connectors within it are also deleted. If you want to keep the elements/controls within a Pool element, you must add those elements/controls outside of the Pool element prior to deleting the Pool element.

If you accidentally delete a Pool element with other elements/connectors you want to keep, then select the **Undo** button.
