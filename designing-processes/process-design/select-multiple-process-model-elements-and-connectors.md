# Select Multiple Process Model Elements and Connectors

## Overview

Select multiple Process model elements and/or [connectors](model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md), collectively referred to as Process model objects, to do any of the following:

* Move multiple selected Process model objects at the same time in relation to each other.
* [Align multiple Process model objects](align-and-distribute-process-model-elements-and-connectors.md#align-process-model-objects), such as to left-align selected objects in different Lane elements.
* [Horizontally or vertically distribute](align-and-distribute-process-model-elements-and-connectors.md#distribute-process-model-objects) three \(3\) or more selected objects.

## Select Multiple Process Model Objects

Follow these steps to select multiple Process model elements and/or connectors, collectively referred to as Process model objects:

1. [View your Processes](../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-active-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new Process](../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/create-a-process.md) or click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.
3. Press the **Shift** key, and then do one of the following:
   * Drag and surround the Process model objects for selection. As you drag, a box displays to indicate which Process model objects are selected.
   * Click each Process model object for selection.
