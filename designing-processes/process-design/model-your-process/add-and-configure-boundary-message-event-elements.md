# Add and Configure Boundary Message Event Elements

## Add a Boundary Message Event Element

{% hint style="info" %}
### Don't Know What a Boundary Message Event Element Is?

See [Process Modeling Element Descriptions](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md) for a description of the [Boundary Message Event](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#boundary-message-event) element.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a Boundary Message Event element to the Process model unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Processes: Edit Processes
* Processes: View Processes

See the [Process](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add a Boundary Message Event element to the Process model:

1. [View your Processes](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-active-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new Process](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/create-a-process.md) or click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.
3. Add the following Process model element or [connector](../model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md) to your Process model in which to associate with the Boundary Error Event element:
   * [Sub Process](add-and-configure-sub-process-elements.md#add-a-sub-process-element) element
   * [Actions By Email](../model-processes-using-connectors/available-connectors-from-processmaker/actions-by-email-connector.md) connector \(requires the [Actions By Email package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/actions-by-email-package.md)\)
4. From the **Boundary Events** drop-down menu, select the **Boundary Message Event** option. The Boundary Message Event element displays on the top of its associating element/connector. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/boundary-message-event-selection-process-modeler-designer.png) 

![Boundary Message Event element associated with a Sub Process element](../../../.gitbook/assets/boundary-message-event-element-process-modeler-designer.png)

After placing the Boundary Message Event element, you may drag it to an adjacent side of its associating element/connector. Since Process Modeler displays labels at the bottom of Process model elements and connectors, the Boundary Message Event element displays best at the bottom of its associating element.

## Settings

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to configure a Boundary Message Event element unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Processes: Edit Processes
* Processes: View Processes

See the [Process](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

The Boundary Message Event element has the following panels that contain settings:

* **Configuration** panel
  * [Edit the element name](add-and-configure-boundary-message-event-elements.md#edit-the-element-name)
  * [Indicate to interrupt the best-case scenario workflow](add-and-configure-boundary-message-event-elements.md#indicate-to-interrupt-the-best-case-scenario-workflow)
* **Advanced** panel
  * [Edit the element's identifier value](add-and-configure-boundary-message-event-elements.md#edit-the-elements-identifier-value)

### Configuration Panel Settings

#### Edit the Element Name

An element name is a human-readable reference for a Process element. Process Modeler automatically assigns the name of a Process element with its element type. However, an element's name can be changed.

Follow these steps to edit the name for a Boundary Message Event element:

1. Ensure that the **Hide Menus** button![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide-menus-button-process-modeler-processes.png)is not enabled. See [Maximize the Process Modeler Canvas View](../navigate-around-your-process-model.md#maximize-the-process-modeler-canvas-view).
2. Select the Boundary Message Event element from the Process model in which to edit its name. Panels to configure this element display.
3. Expand the **Configuration** panel if it is not presently expanded. The **Name** setting displays. This is a required setting. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/boundary-message-event-configuration-name-process-modeler-designer.png) 
4. In the **Name** setting, edit the selected element's name and then press **Enter**.

#### Indicate to Interrupt the Best-Case Scenario Workflow

Indicate whether the Boundary Message Event element interrupts the best-case scenario workflow:

* **Interrupting workflow:** When workflow routes through the Boundary Message Event element, workflow is interrupted and does not route through the best-case scenario. As highlighted in the example below, workflow routes through the Boundary Message Event element if that element receives a message from the child Request. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/boundary-message-event-interrupting-example.png) 
* **Non-interrupting workflow:** Workflow routes both through the Boundary Message Event element and the best-case scenario, thereby creating parallel workflow in that Request. As highlighted in the example below, workflow routes through the Boundary Message Event element if that element receives a message from the child Request; however, after the child Request completes and workflow resumes in the parent Request, the Sub Process element completes and routes through the best-case scenario. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/boundary-message-event-non-interrupting-example.png)

Follow these steps to indicate if this Boundary Message Event element interrupts the best-case scenario workflow when it triggers:

1. Ensure that the **Hide Menus** button![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide-menus-button-process-modeler-processes.png)is not enabled. See [Maximize the Process Modeler Canvas View](../navigate-around-your-process-model.md#maximize-the-process-modeler-canvas-view).
2. Select the Boundary Message Event element from the Process model in which to indicate if it interrupts the best-case scenario workflow. Panels to configure this element display.
3. Expand the **Configuration** panel if it is not presently expanded, and then locate the **Interrupting** setting. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/interrupting-boundary-event-process-modeler-designer.png) 
4. From the **Interrupting** checkbox, indicate whether this Boundary Message Event element interrupts the best-case scenario workflow when it triggers. When the **Interrupting** checkbox is selected, which is the default setting, this element interrupts the best-case scenario workflow.

### Advanced Panel Settings

#### Edit the Element's Identifier Value

Process Modeler automatically assigns a unique value to each Process element added to a Process model. However, an element's identifier value can be changed if it is unique to all other elements in the Process model, including the Process model's identifier value.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All identifier values for all elements in the Process model must be unique.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to edit the identifier value for a Boundary Message Event element:

1. Ensure that the **Hide Menus** button![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide-menus-button-process-modeler-processes.png)is not enabled. See [Maximize the Process Modeler Canvas View](../navigate-around-your-process-model.md#maximize-the-process-modeler-canvas-view).
2. Select the Boundary Message Event element from the Process model in which to edit its identifier value. Panels to configure this element display.
3. Expand the **Advanced** panel if it is not presently expanded. The **Node Identifier** setting displays. This is a required setting. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/boundary-message-event-configuration-identifier-process-modeler-processes.png) 
4. In the **Node Identifier** setting, edit the Boundary Message Event element's identifier to a unique value from all elements in the Process model and then press **Enter**.
