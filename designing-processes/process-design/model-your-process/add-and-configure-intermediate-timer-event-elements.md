# Intermediate Timer Event Element

## Permissions Required

{% hint style="info" %}
### Don't Know What an Intermediate Timer Event Element Is?

See [Process Modeling Element Descriptions](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md) for a description of the [Intermediate Timer Event](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#intermediate-timer-event) element.
{% endhint %}

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to configure an Intermediate Timer Event element in the Process model unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Processes: Edit Processes
* Processes: View Processes

See the [Process](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

## Add an Intermediate Timer Event Element

{% hint style="info" %}
[Permissions are required to do this](add-and-configure-intermediate-timer-event-elements.md#permissions-required).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add an Intermediate Timer Event element to the Process model:

1. [View your Processes](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-active-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new Process](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/create-a-process.md) or click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.
3. Locate the **Intermediate Event** element in the **Elements and Connectors** palette that is to the left of the Process Modeler canvas. If the [**Hide Menus** button](../navigate-around-your-process-model.md#maximize-the-process-modeler-canvas-view)![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide-menus-button-process-modeler-processes.png)is enabled, the **Elements and Connectors** palette displays the **Intermediate Event** element's icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/intermediate-event-icon-process-modeler-processes.png). ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/intermediate-event-control-process-modeler-processes.png) 
4. Drag the element into the Process model canvas where you want to place it. If a Pool element is in your Process model, the Intermediate Timer Event element cannot be placed outside of the Pool element.
5. Do one of the following:
   * From the **Elements** drop-down menu, select the **Intermediate Timer Event** option. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/intermediate-timer-event-selection-process-modeler-designer.png) 
   * Click anywhere in the Process model. The Intermediate Timer Event element selects by default.

![Intermediate Timer Event element](../../../.gitbook/assets/intermediate-timer-event-process-modeler-processes.png)

After the element is placed into the Process model, you may adjust its location in the following ways:

* Move the element by dragging it to a new location.
* [Select the element with other elements and/or connectors](../select-multiple-process-model-elements-and-connectors.md#select-multiple-process-model-objects), and then move them collectively by dragging them to new locations in relation to one another.
* [Align](../align-and-distribute-process-model-elements-and-connectors.md#align-process-model-objects) and/or [distribute](../align-and-distribute-process-model-elements-and-connectors.md#distribute-process-model-objects) the element in relation to other selected elements and/or [connectors](../model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Moving an Intermediate Timer Event element has the following limitations in regards to the following Process model elements:

* **Pool element:** If the Intermediate Timer Event element is inside of a [Pool](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#pool) element, it cannot be moved outside of the Pool element. If you attempt to do so, Process Modeler places the Intermediate Timer Event element inside the Pool element closest to where you attempt to move it.
* **Lane element:** If the Intermediate Timer Event element is inside of a Lane element, it can be moved to another Lane element in the same Pool element. However, the Intermediate Timer Event element cannot be moved outside of the Pool element.
{% endhint %}

## Change the Color of an Intermediate Timer Event Element

The Intermediate Timer Event element and label have a default yellow color to indicate that this element is an intermediate [Request](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) event. After an Intermediate Timer Event element is [added to a Process model](add-and-configure-intermediate-timer-event-elements.md#add-an-intermediate-timer-event-element), its shape and label color can be changed. Element and [connector](../model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md) colors may only be changed individually.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Permissions are required to do this](add-and-configure-intermediate-timer-event-elements.md#permissions-required).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to change the color and label for an Intermediate Timer Event element:

1. [View your Processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. Click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.
3. Select the Intermediate Timer Event element to change its color. Available options display above the selected element. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/change-color-intermediate-timer-event-element-process-modeler-designer.png) 
4. Click the **Open Color Palette** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-color-palette-icon-process-modeler-designer.png). The color palette displays.
5. Do one of the following:
   * **Select a color swatch:** Select one of the color swatches from the color palette. The Intermediate Timer Event element and label change to that color.
   * **Specify a custom color:** Click the![](../../../.gitbook/assets/color-selector-swatch-process-modeler-designer.png)icon to display the color selector, and then select a color, enter the [Hex color code](https://www.color-hex.com/), or enter the red, green, blue, and alpha color values for the custom color. The Intermediate Timer Event element and label change to that color. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/color-selector-process-modeler-designer.png) 
   * **Reset to the default color:** Click the![](../../../.gitbook/assets/reset-color-icon-process-modeler-designer.png)icon to reset the Intermediate Timer Event element and label to its default color.

## Replace an Intermediate Timer Event Element with a Different Intermediate Request Event Element

After an Intermediate Timer Event element is [added to a Process model](add-and-configure-intermediate-timer-event-elements.md#add-an-intermediate-timer-event-element), you may replace it with a different intermediate [Request](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) event element:

* [Intermediate Signal Catch Event](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#intermediate-signal-catch-event) element
* [Intermediate Signal Throw Event](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#intermediate-signal-throw-event) element
* [Intermediate Message Catch Event](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#intermediate-message-catch-event) element
* [Intermediate Message Throw Event](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#intermediate-message-throw-event) element

The selected Intermediate Timer Event element is replaced by the default settings and color of the replacing element.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Permissions are required to do this](add-and-configure-intermediate-timer-event-elements.md#permissions-required).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to replace an Intermediate Timer Event element with a different intermediate Request event element:

1. â€‹[View your Processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. Click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.
3. Select the Intermediate Timer Event element to change to another intermediate Request event element. Available options display above the selected element.
4. Click the **Elements** icon. The **Elements** drop-down menu displays the intermediate Request event elements. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/change-element-intermediate-timer-event-process-modeler-designer.png) 
5. Select the element to replace the Intermediate Timer Event element. The **Change Type** screen displays to confirm replacing the currently selected element. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/change-type-screen-process-modeler-designer.png) 
6. Click **Confirm**. The new element replaces the Intermediate Timer Event element with its default settings and color.

## Copy an Intermediate Timer Event Element

Copying an Intermediate Timer Event element copies the original along with its current settings, making it easier and faster to continue designing without adding default elements or [connectors](../model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md) with their default settings.

The copied Intermediate Timer Event element displays below the original. Any [Sequence Flow](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#sequence-flow) and/or [Message Flow](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#message-flow) elements incoming to or outgoing from the original are not copied.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Permissions are required to do this](add-and-configure-intermediate-timer-event-elements.md#permissions-required).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to copy an Intermediate Timer Event element in your Process model:

1. â€‹[View your Processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. Click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.

4. Click the **Copy Element** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/copy-element-icon-process-modeler-designer.png). The Process model element copies. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/copied-intermediate-timer-event-element-process-modeler-designer.png) 

## Delete an Intermediate Timer Event Element

Deleting a Process model element also deletes any [Sequence Flow](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#sequence-flow) and/or [Message Flow](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#message-flow) elements incoming to or outgoing from that element. For example, if a Process model element is deleted that has both incoming and outgoing Sequence Flow elements, the Sequence Flow elements must be reconnected for the remaining elements/[connectors](../model-processes-using-connectors/what-is-a-connector.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
[Permissions are required to do this](add-and-configure-intermediate-timer-event-elements.md#permissions-required).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to delete an Intermediate Timer Event element from your Process model:

1. â€‹[View your Processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
