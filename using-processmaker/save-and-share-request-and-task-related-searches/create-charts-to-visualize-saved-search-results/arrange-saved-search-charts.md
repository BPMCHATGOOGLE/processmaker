## Arrange the Order of Saved Search Charts

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To arrange the order of the charts created for a [Saved Search's](../what-is-a-saved-search.md) results, the [Saved Searches package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to arrange the order of the charts of a Saved Search:

1. [View the search results for a Saved Search](../view-saved-searches-that-are-shared-with-you/view-search-results-for-a-saved-search.md) in which to view its charts. The **Data** tab displays the data details for that Saved Search.
2. Click the **Charts** tab. The **Charts** tab displays all charts created for this Saved Search. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/request-type-charts-tab-saved-search-package.png) 
3. Hold the![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrange-move-chart-icon-saved-searches-package.png)icon that displays to the left of the chart's title, and then drag that chart to the location on the **Charts** tab to display that chart.
