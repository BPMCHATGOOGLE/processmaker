# Copy a Saved Search Chart

## Copy a Saved Search Chart

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To copy a [Saved Search](../what-is-a-saved-search.md) chart, the [Saved Searches package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to arrange the order of the charts of a Saved Search:

1. [View the search results for a Saved Search](../view-saved-searches-that-are-shared-with-you/view-search-results-for-a-saved-search.md) in which to view its charts. The **Data** tab displays the data details for that Saved Search.
2. Click the **Charts** tab. The **Charts** tab displays all charts created for this Saved Search.
3. Click the **Copy Chart** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/copy-duplicate-chart-icon-saved-searches-package.png)for the chart from which to make a copy. The copied chart uses the same name as the source chart with the word **Copy** appended to it.
