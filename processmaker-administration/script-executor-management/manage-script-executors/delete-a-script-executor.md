# Delete a Script Executor

## Delete a ProcessMaker Script Executor

{% hint style="warning" %}
When a ProcessMaker Script Executor is deleted, all [ProcessMaker Scripts](../../../designing-processes/scripts/what-is-a-script.md) that run during a [Request](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) fail. ProcessMaker designers that have developed ProcessMaker Scripts configured to use a deleted Script Executor are not notified of that Script Executor's deletion. When a ProcessMaker designer reviews or edits the [ProcessMaker Script configuration](../../../designing-processes/scripts/manage-scripts/edit-script-configuration.md#configure-a-processmaker-script) settings for a Script configured to use a deleted Script Executor, that Script Executor does not display from the **Language** setting. Therefore, take caution when deleting a ProcessMaker Script Executor.

Deleting a ProcessMaker Script Executor from the **Script Executors** page cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to delete a ProcessMaker Script Executor:

1. [View your ProcessMaker Script Executors](view-script-executors.md#view-all-processmaker-script-executors). The **Script Executors** page displays.
2. Click the **Delete** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/trash-icon-process-modeler-processes.png)for the ProcessMaker Script Executor to delete.

3. Click **Confirm**.
