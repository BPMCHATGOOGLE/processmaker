## Customize the ProcessMaker User Interface

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account must have the **Make this user a Super Admin** option selected to customize the ProcessMaker user interface.

See [Edit a User Account](add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md#edit-a-processmaker-user-account) or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to customize the ProcessMaker user interface \(UI\) in your instance:

1. [Log on](../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Admin** option from the top menu. The **Users** page displays.
3. Click the **Customize UI** icon![](../.gitbook/assets/customize-ui-icon-admin.png). The **Customize UI** page displays.
4. The logo and icon in the ProcessMaker UI work together: the logo represents the complete name, tagline and any other trademarked assets for the brand; the icon represents the stand-alone icon for the brand. In ProcessMaker, the logo displays when the icon is clicked; the icon displays again when the logo is clicked.

   Follow these guidelines to change the default logo and icon, if necessary:

   1. From the **Custom Logo** field, click the **Upload File** button, and then locate the image to display as the brand's logo. Use a transparent PNG image at 150 by 40 pixels for best results.
   2. From the **Custom Icon** field, click the **Upload File** button, and then locate the image to display as the brand's icon. Use a transparent PNG image at 40 by 40 pixels for best results.

5. Follow these guidelines to change any of the colors that comprise a ProcessMaker color scheme \(as described in the [Overview](customize-the-processmaker-user-interface.md) section\), if necessary:
   1. Click the hex color value for the color that you want to change. The color picker palette displays. ![](../.gitbook/assets/customize-ui-color-picker-palette-admin.png) 
   2. Do one of the following:
      * In the **Hex** field, enter the hex color value for your selected color, and then press **Enter**.
      * Enter the RGBA \(red, green, blue and alpha\) color values for your selected color.
      * Click one of the color swatches \(or the transparency swatch\) to select your color.
      * Click inside the color palette to select your color.
6. From the **Custom Font** drop-down menu, optionally select one of the fonts described in the [Overview](customize-the-processmaker-user-interface.md#overview) section to display all text in ProcessMaker.
7. Click **Save**. ProcessMaker regenerates the UI. ![](../.gitbook/assets/regenerate-css-files-message-customize-ui-admin.png) 
8. Clear the current web browser session \(**Ctrl+F5** for most web browsers\). Your web browser window refreshes to display your changes to the ProcessMaker UI.
